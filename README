How to run? (use lena_std_short.bmp as input image)

1.		Change directory to splited/stratus, type "cd splited/stratus"

2.a.	Run behavioral simulation, type "make sim_B"
2.b.	Check result in "./bdw_work/sims/B/bdw_sim.log"

3.a.	Run synthesis and Verilog simulation with HLS configuration BASIC, type "make sim_BASIC"
3.b.	Check result in "./bdw_work/sims/V_BASIC/bdw_sim.log" and "./bdw_work/modules/GaussFilter/BASIC/stratus_hls.log"

4.a.	Run synthesis and Verilog simulation with HLS configuration DPA, type "make sim_DPA"
4.b.	Check result in "./bdw_work/sims/V_DPA/bdw_sim.log" and "./bdw_work/modules/GaussFilter/DPA/stratus_hls.log"

5.		All simulation steps above will get output image as "./out.bmp"

6.		Change directory to splited/stratus, type "cd nonsplited/stratus"

7.a.	Run behavioral simulation, type "make sim_B"
7.b.	Check result in "./bdw_work/sims/B/bdw_sim.log"

8.a.	Run synthesis and Verilog simulation with HLS configuration BASIC, type "make sim_BASIC"
8.b.	Check result in "./bdw_work/sims/V_BASIC/bdw_sim.log" and "./bdw_work/modules/GaussFilter/BASIC/stratus_hls.log"

9.a.	Run synthesis and Verilog simulation with HLS configuration DPA, type "make sim_DPA"
9.b.	Check result in "./bdw_work/sims/V_DPA/bdw_sim.log" and "./bdw_work/modules/GaussFilter/DPA/stratus_hls.log"

10.		All simulation steps above will get output image as "./out.bmp"
